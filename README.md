ðŸš€ Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 Developed a deep learning-based object detection system using the YOLOv8 model to detect multiple objects in real-time from images and live video streams (webcam/CCTV). The model identifies and tracks objects like people, cars, animals, etc., with high accuracy and speed.
